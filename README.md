==============

A simple photo editor to demonstrate DIP Algorithms using python. This was created for the purpose of
lab assessments for Image processing and Pattern recognition.

Algorithms Used:
FFT (Radix 2 Decimation in time)
Histogram Equalization
Simple Intensity Transformations
Thresholding-Global and Otsu's
Image filtering using Convolution with comman masks and Laplacian
Image filtering in Fourier Domain
Median Filtering
Canny Edge Detection

How To use:
To use, just Run main.py script

Packages required
1. Python 2.7+
2. Numpy 1.6+
3. PIL 1.7+
4. Matplotlib 1.2+
